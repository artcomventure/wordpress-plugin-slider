## Plugin Updates

Although the plugin is not _yet_ listed on https://wordpress.org/plugins/, you can use WordPress' update functionality to keep it in sync with the files from [GitHub](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-slider).

Please use for this our [WordPress Repository Updater](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-repoUpdater).

_We test our plugin through its paces, but we advise you to take all safety precautions before the update. Just in case of the unexpected._
